SPEC-1-Advanced Mean Reversion Trading Bot

Background

Advanced mean reversion trading strategies aim to exploit statistical deviations from a calculated mean price or value of an asset, capturing profitable reversals when the price returns toward the mean. By automating signal generation, portfolio execution, and risk management, a bot can consistently apply these strategies at scale across multiple markets and timeframes.

Assumptions:

The bot will support backtesting via the yfinance API for equities data.

It will support live trading modes and interface with broker APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca).

Initial asset classes include equities, with potential extension to FX or commodities.

Timeframes cover all resolutions, from tick-level through intraday (e.g., 1m, 5m, 15m) up to daily, weekly, and monthly bars.

Requirements

Must Have

Backtesting Engine using yfinance data for historical equity prices across all timeframes (tick, 1m, 5m, 15m, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly).

Strategy Module implementing mean reversion signals (e.g., moving average bands, z-score thresholds).

Execution Engine capable of placing market and limit orders via broker APIs (Interactive Brokers, Alpaca).

Risk Management features including position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, max drawdown limits, and risk compounding rules (dynamic scaling of position sizes based on performance).

Data Storage for historical and live data (time-series database or optimized file storage).

Should Have

Performance Metrics Dashboard for P&L, Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown visualization.

Parameter Optimization support (grid search, walk-forward analysis), parameter tweaking interface for manual adjustments, and automated hyperparameter tuning modules.

Multi-Asset Support groundwork to add FX/commodities later.

Could Have

Paper Trading Mode replicating live trading without real capital.

Notification System (email/Slack) for trade alerts and system health.

Won't Have (v1)

Crypto exchange integrations (to be added later).

Method

The architecture will consist of the following core components:

Data Ingestion & Storage

Use yfinance client to fetch historical and live price bars.

Store live and normalized time-series in PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB extension optional for hypertables).

Persist historical backtesting data in a separate schema or database (e.g., historical_prices table or dedicated DB/schema) to isolate test data from production/live data.

Backtesting Engine

Simulate step-by-step (candle-by-candle) strategy execution using historical data.

Integrate Strategy Module signals and Risk Manager rules to produce simulated orders and P&L.

Strategy Module

Calculate mean reversion indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, z-score bands) based on configurable lookback windows.

Expose parameter API for dynamic threshold adjustments and parameter tweaking UI integration.

Risk Manager

Enforce stop-loss, take-profit, max drawdown, and dynamic risk compounding rules.

Compute position size per trade based on account equity, risk percentage, and performance-based scaling.

Execution Engine

Abstract broker interfaces (IB, Alpaca) with adapters supporting market and limit orders.

Provide paper and live modes, order status callbacks, and retry logic.

Dashboard & Monitoring

Real-time P&L, key performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown), and system health logs.

REST API or web UI for live parameter tweaking, strategy control, and visualization.

Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

@startuml
table raw_prices {
  timestamp TIMESTAMP PRIMARY KEY
  symbol VARCHAR
  open DOUBLE
  high DOUBLE
  low DOUBLE
  close DOUBLE
  volume BIGINT
}

table normalized_prices {
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
  symbol VARCHAR
  moving_avg DOUBLE
  std_dev DOUBLE
  z_score DOUBLE
  PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, symbol)
}

table historical_prices {
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
  symbol VARCHAR
  open DOUBLE
  high DOUBLE
  low DOUBLE
  close DOUBLE
  volume BIGINT
  PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, symbol)
}

Implementation

Environment Setup

Configure Python environment (3.9+) with dependencies: pandas, numpy, yfinance, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, FastAPI/Flask, Plotly/Streamlit.

Initialize PostgreSQL database and apply schema migrations (via Alembic).

Data Layer

Develop yfinance client module to fetch and normalize data across resolutions.

Implement database repository classes (CRUD) for raw, normalized, and historical tables.

Core Engines

Build Backtesting Engine: simulator class handling data iteration, signal injection, order simulation, P&L recording.

Build Strategy Module: indicator calculation and signal generator.

Build Risk Manager: position sizing and risk rule enforcement.

Build Execution Engine: broker adapter interfaces with mock for paper trading.

Dashboard & API

Create REST endpoints for strategy control, parameter updates, and metrics retrieval.

Develop web UI or notebook integration for visualization and manual tweaking.

Testing & Validation

Unit tests for each module (pytest).

Integration tests simulating end-to-end backtest runs.

Backtest a sample equity universe to validate P&L behavior and risk constraints.

Milestones

M1 (Week 1-2): Environment setup, DB schema, yfinance ingestion module.

M2 (Week 3-4): Core engines (Backtesting, Strategy, Risk).

M3 (Week 5-6): Execution adapter, paper trading integration, basic dashboard.

M4 (Week 7-8): Parameter optimization, hyperparameter tuning modules.

M5 (Week 9-10): Full-system integration tests, performance tuning.

M6 (Week 11): Final documentation, deployment pipeline setup.

Gathering Results

Compare backtest performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown) against benchmarks.

Validate risk compliance via simulated drawdown scenarios.

Monitor strategy behavior in paper trading for real-time drift.

Iterate parameters based on dashboard insights and optimization results.
